School Management System – SQL Project

Project Overview

The School Management System is a comprehensive SQL-based project implemented in PostgreSQL.  
It simulates a real-life school environment, managing students, teachers, classes, subjects, marks, attendance, and fees.  

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills including table creation, data insertion, complex queries, aggregation, joins, CTEs, and analytical reporting.  
It is ideal for learning SQL, showcasing database management skills, and building a portfolio for data analysis or backend database projects.

 1. Student Management
- Stores student details: ID, name, age, gender, class, and section.  
- Tracks daily student attendance and calculates attendance percentages.  
- Records marks for multiple subjects and calculates average scores.  
- Identifies students with low attendance or failing marks.  
- Tracks fee payments and identifies students with pending fees.

 2. Teacher Management
- Stores teacher information: ID, name, subjects taught, and daily salary.  
- Tracks teacher attendance and late arrivals.  
- Calculates teacher salaries based on attendance, including penalties for late arrivals.

 3. Class and Subject Management
- Maintains class and section information.  
- Manages subjects taught in the school.  
- Provides class-wise and subject-wise analytics for performance reporting.

 4. Analytics and Reporting
- Calculates attendance percentages for students.  
- Ranks top-performing students based on average marks.  
- Identifies students with poor performance or frequent absenteeism.  
- Computes class-wise average marks and subject-wise pass percentages.  
- Provides daily summaries of teacher attendance and late arrivals.

 SQL Concepts Used
Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN for relational data management.  
- Aggregations: COUNT, AVG, ROUND for analytics.  
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): For modular and readable queries.  
Conditional Logic: CASE statements for metrics like salary calculation and pass/fail status.  
Date Filtering: To analyze attendance, marks, and fee data over time.

 Purpose
This project is designed to simulate real-world database scenarios and demonstrate:
- Effective relational database design and normalization.  
- Handling multiple related entities in PostgreSQL.  
- Writing professional and reusable SQL queries.  
- Generating reports and insights for decision-making.  

It is suitable for SQL learners, data analysts, and developers who want to showcase database management and analytical skills.
